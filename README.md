#NextJS testing, linting, typescript and CI/CD repo w/ Github Actions

Here is a repo of a boilerplate setup for starting a NextJS Project with EsLint, testing via React-Testing-Library and Jest and Typescript with continuous integration and continuous development with Github Actions.

Note: Due to conflicts with Eslint and Next in CI pipeline support for older versions of Node [12.x, 14.x] had to be removed in the .yml file
so only Node version 16.x is set
